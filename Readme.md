The WACC of a unit holder is also impacted by the units of fund they are alloted during the IPO. Therefore, it is crucial to merge the IPO allottment data to the floorsheet csv file before running the program. 

# Floorsheet Format (Input)
The floorsheet format is as provided by NEPSE. New calculated columns should be added to calculate broker and sebon comission. Effective rate should be calculated for each transaction in the floorsheet.
